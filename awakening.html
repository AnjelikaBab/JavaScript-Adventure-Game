  <div class='containerawakening'>

  <p> <span class= "avatar" > </span> wakes up with his head pounding as his eyes adjust to the light. He takes in his surroundings and sees trees upon trees which seem to go on forever. He can’t remember how he got there or what he’s supposed to be doing. All he knows is that he is the avatar and there is definitely something wrong if he woke up unconscious with none of his memories. </p>

  <p> "I can sense you are awake, I can only talk for intervals at a time. You will enter the town of greed because it is a ticket that you need. This realm is filled with men who will do anything for some gems." </p>

 <p> <span class= "avatar" > </span>  gets into fighting position ready to use self defence, however, nobody is there. He can’t quite understand why he heard this voice but it sounded like…. He just can’t remember at all. <span class= "avatar" > </span>  thinks about this rhyme as he continues to see where he has awoken. To his right there is a beautiful village and to the left he can see some sort of mine.. or perhaps a cavern? The forest is eerie and he is eager to get a move on. </p>
