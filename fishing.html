<h1> Time to Fish! </h1>
<p> Here is the lake where your job is to go fishing. The voice told you to go here but all you can think about is how hungry the puppy looked. Go fish until you are able to catch something to cook for him. Since The Avatar does not have  a fishing rod, he will have to use his air and water powers to try to pick up on something. </p>

<h2>Rules: </h2> <!-- The combo is 3 and 3 -->
<p> You will have to guess the correct combination of how much element power and how much distance is needed to catch a fish. Both have a range from 1-5 as shown below so use trial and error to feed that puppy! </p>

<p>
  <label class ="fishinglabel"for="slider"> Element Power:</label>
  <input type="range" id="power" class="slider" name="slider" min="1" max="5" />
   <span id="numberp"> </span>
</p>

<p>
  <label class ="fishinglabel" for="slider"> Distance From Shore(m):</label>
  <input type="range" id="distance" class="slider" name="slider" min="1" max="5" />
  <span id="numberd"> </span>
</p>

<button onclick="fishing()">Fish</button>
