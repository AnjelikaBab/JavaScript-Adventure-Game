  <p>After defeating the fire lord you and your best friend reunite and they tell you how telekinesis forbids them from speaking for longer than 10 seconds and that they are only allowed to speak in rhymes. It also appears that the fire lord cast a spell on you to lose all your memories and tried to get you as far from the fire nation borders as possible. Luckily, the spell was broken because Appa's uniqueness triggered your memory and your best friend helped guide you. You celebrate your victory and fly away together on Appa. </p>
